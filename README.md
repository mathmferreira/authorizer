## Getting Started üöÄ

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Gradle

The project uses **Docker Compose** for containerization of the database. You'll need to install docker compose in your local machine to run the database locally.

### ‚Äç‚úÖÔ∏è Rules

#### Example Request

This is an example of request for authorize a transaction. (All the fields are required)

```json
{
  "account": "123",
  "totalAmount": 100.00,
  "mcc": 5411,
  "merchant": "Supermarket XYZ"
}
```

#### Transaction Authorization Rules
- If `mcc` is `"5411"` or `"5412"`, the `FOOD` balance will be used.
- If `mcc` is `"5811"` or `"5812"`, the `MEAL` balance will be used.
- For any other `mcc` values, the `CASH` balance will be used as fallback.
- If the benefit balance has insufficient amount then `CASH` balance will be used as fallback.
- Sometimes, the `mcc` are incorrect and a transaction must be processed taking into account the merchant's data as well. Register merchants using the `import.sql` file located at `src/main/resources/` to make sure that the name will be considered.

#### Default Merchants

```
Merchant Name             Type
-------------------------------
UBER EATS                 MEAL
PADARIA DO ZE             FOOD
RESTAURANTE DA MARIA      MEAL
SUPERMERCADOS BH          FOOD
```
* **Remember**: For more merchants just add them in the insert query on `import.sql`

#### Possible Responses
- `{ "code": "00" }` if the transaction is **approved**
- `{ "code": "51" }` if the transaction is **declined** due to insufficient funds
- `{ "code": "07" }` for any other issue preventing the transaction
